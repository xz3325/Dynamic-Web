### Inspiration
In northern Japan lies a remarkable testament to human artistry and cultural preservation - the Goshogawara Tachineputa Festival. These colossal lantern floats, standing 23 meters tall and weighing 19 tons each, represent an fusion of traditional craftsmanship and community spirit. Each Tachineputa is a masterpiece of human ingenuity, entirely handcrafted through a meticulous year-long process of design, painting, and assembly. These paper lanterns depict mythological scenes. 

What truly distinguishes this festival is the city's profound commitment to cultural preservation - the local government even undertook urban renovations, burying power lines underground, to ensure these towering floats could continue their traditional parade routes. Through the combined efforts of skilled artisans, dedicated local residents who manually pull these massive structures, and thoughtful governance, this once-fading tradition has been transformed into a vibrant celebration that captivates visitors from across Japan and beyond.
