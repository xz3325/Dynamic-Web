    <h1>The Tachineputa Festival</h1>
    <p>A towering tradition in northern Japan</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In northern Japan lies a remarkable testament to human artistry and cultural preservation — the Goshogawara Tachineputa Festival. These colossal lantern floats, standing 23 meters tall and weighing 19 tons each, represent a fusion of traditional craftsmanship and community spirit. Each Tachineputa is a masterpiece of human ingenuity, entirely handcrafted through a meticulous year-long process of design, painting, and assembly. These paper lanterns depict mythological scenes.</p>

      <h2>Preservation Through Innovation</h2>
      <p>What truly distinguishes this festival is the city's profound commitment to cultural preservation — the local government even undertook urban renovations, burying power lines underground, to ensure these towering floats could continue their traditional parade routes. Through the combined efforts of skilled artisans, dedicated local residents who manually pull these massive structures, and thoughtful governance, this once-fading tradition has been transformed into a vibrant celebration that captivates visitors from across Japan and beyond.</p>

      <h2>Festival Origins and Regional Variations</h2>
      <p>Aomori, located at the northernmost tip of Japan's main island, holds a week-long summer festival in early August to ward off "Neputa" (sleep demons) that might interfere with farmers' summer work. During this week, each city in Aomori Prefecture showcases newly created lantern floats, each with distinct characteristics. Aomori’s are human-shaped and flat; Hirosaki’s are fan-shaped; while Goshogawara’s Tachineputa are the tallest and most impressive.</p>

      <h2>Tradition in Motion</h2>
      <p>At Goshogawara’s annual Tachineputa Festival, smaller and medium-sized floats lead the way, followed by three massive 23-meter-tall paper lantern floats. These lanterns are carried by people of all ages — children, youth, middle-aged, and elderly — maintaining their tradition. The parade proceeds in an orderly fashion amid rhythmic chants. The 2024 theme features “Enma”, the Buddhist King of Hell, depicted using a mirror to reflect and judge the deeds of the deceased.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Decline and Revival</h2>
      <p>Tachineputa flourished due to Goshogawara‘s advantageous coastal trading position. The tradition had nearly vanished due to new power lines, war, post-war fires, economic decline, and demographic aging. But in 1993, a rediscovered float base design drawing sparked a revival. By 1996, community funding and effort allowed a float to be reconstructed — and, in accordance with ancient custom, ceremonially burned a week after the festival.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modern Preservation Efforts</h2>
      <p>In 1998, the city government completed the project of removing and burying power lines along the parade route. Since 1999, a new large Tachineputa has been created annually, while an old one is dismantled. The local government's commitment to cultural preservation is remarkable — reclaiming this historical practice in just five years through urban planning and community support.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>According to the official website, the latest three floats were designed and created by the same person, with a year-long design and production cycle. Tachineputa are built and stored in a dedicated museum. Typically, visitors can participate in the creation process. However, in 2025, major renovations at the museum mean no new float will be created. This year’s festival will showcase the previous three floats, and both participatory creation and museum visits will be suspended.</p>
